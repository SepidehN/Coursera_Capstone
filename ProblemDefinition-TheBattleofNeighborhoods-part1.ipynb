    "Buying a house has always been a great adventure, especially when it is the first home. However, at the same time, it can be very challenging too. Finding a proper location to buy a house is not a straightforward task. Many factors need to be considered to analyse and compare different locations suitability. For example, closeness to the workplace, kids' schools or leisure centres, safety and accessibility to hospitals, public transport or motorways can be critical factors. The list is not exhaustive. The problem gets more challenging than ever if you are new to the area and you have no idea about the different parts of the city. Suppose that you have moved to a new country and you picked a city in which to live.  If you want to pick an area in that city to buy a house, where should it be?\n",
